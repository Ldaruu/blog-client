				Of course, not everything in your report will exactly be you, there are
				so many factors that make you, you. We found the best way to approach
				your Gravity report is to use it as a guide to understand your
				predispositions. The report can give you an idea about your underlying

				Or now I understand why I’m always doing x y z. We hope you enjoy the
				journey and take something from these reports. We know we did.
